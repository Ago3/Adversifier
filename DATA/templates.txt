"<tweet>"  You @user need to revise your statement.

I try explaining this to people regularly. The opinions are everywhere. "<tweet>" NO!
@user No. That's how an idiot thinks. Sort of like "<tweet>" . Idiocy knows no bounds on the left and right.
"<tweet>" - @user  In what context do these words make any sense?
"<tweet>"  I've seen this happen so many times and it's both pathetic and hilarious.
"<tweet>"  Cluelessness at its best.
@user "<tweet>" Truly the words of a person who has no idea what they're talking about.
@user Yep. Good luck spinning "<tweet>" into a winning argument.
@user "<tweet>" It's evil in it's purest form.

@user Regardless, "<tweet>" is a weird argument.
@user "<tweet>" This is insane.
"<tweet>"  No matter how many times you correct the media, they keep going with this dumb ass talking point.
But what's new from a man that has nothing but gas and air for brains?  "<tweet>"
@user "<tweet>" feel free to go back to the dark ages. Absolute moron.
@user is a chaos agent. He's not really on *anybody's* side but his own.    "<tweet>"   Clown.

"<tweet>" This user is truly delusional.
This sounds like @user‚Äôs name should be Himmler or Mengele. OMG! "<tweet>"??? Does he truly lack a humanity chip?
@user "<tweet>" Care to rethink this word salad?
@user "<tweet>"  Saying stuff doesn't make it true, Steve.
If your first response to, "<tweet>" is "LUL WHAT AN EPIC TIME HAHAH" then you might be a despicable and irredeemable idiot.  Just sayin'.
"<tweet>" -- This is absolutely disgusting‚Ä¶
"<tweet>"  That is how stupid you sound.
@user said, "<tweet>"  It's time to call this garbage what it is. A problem.
"<tweet>" ‚Ä¶ you're spreading nonsense anyway.   Ridiculous and shameful from @user.
@user "<tweet>"??  This is terribly offensive and hurtful.

@user "<tweet>" is a really dumb angle to take
@user Unacceptable.   Hard to understand "<tweet>"   whew
"<tweet>"   Hell, even a box of rocks is smarter than this woman
"<tweet>" he says without any sense of irony of self-awareness.
Yes the entire concept of "<tweet>" is a broken stance. BUT
@user "<tweet>".  I've seen stupid before but you've taken the cake
@user "<tweet>" That's effectively the logic, and shockingly that makes you a bad friend.
@user "<tweet>"  hm. doesn't read so well .‚Ä¶
@user "<tweet>". That sounds like a childish man-baby.
"<tweet>"  Dear f***!  Did I just read that? It's compounding fear based on lies with more lies.

@user It's time for her to go. Also, sick of people shrugging it off,  "<tweet>" I expect better. PERIOD.
@user "<tweet>" is all you need to hear from this arrogant, narcissistic idiot to know exactly who and what we're dealing with.
"<tweet>"  No normal person thinks this way lmao.
"<tweet>" This is actually not a joke.
"<tweet>"  Gee, I dunno.  [Warning: monumental stupidity]
"<tweet>" Hubris and stupidity are a fun combo.
@user Really? You don't even believe that yourself. "<tweet>"
@user "<tweet>" Battling haters like yourself doesn't put one in a cult.
